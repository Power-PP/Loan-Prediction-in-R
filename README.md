# Problem Statement
To automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Education, Income, Marital Status, Loan Amount and others. And to identify the customer segments, which are eligible for loan amount

# Dataset
We sourced  [this particular dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mandalravi/loan-prediction-data)  from Kaggle. The dataset includes variables like Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

The loan here is one where customers should pay off all of their loan debt in just one time by the end of the term, instead of an installment schedule. Of course, they could pay off earlier than their pay schedule.
